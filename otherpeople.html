    <h2 id="whiteshadow"> Sylvia Rivera </h2>
    <p> <h3> Activist </h3> 
    <h3> b. 1951-2002 </h3> </p>
    <p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="https://legacyprojectchicago.org/sites/default/files/2017-06/Sylvia%20Rivera%20Holding%20a%20Teddy%20Bear.jpg" alt="Headshot of Sylvia Rivera" width="60%" height="30%"/> 
    </p>
    <p>Sylvia Rivera was born in the Bronx, New York, hailing from Puerto Rican and Venezuelan descent. She suffered a troubled childhood—abandoned, orphaned, rejected, and beaten. By age 11, she ran away from home and became a child prostitute. While living on the streets, a group of drag queens embraced and welcomed her, and she identified as a drag queen named “Sylvia.” Her activism took shape with the surge of the Civil Rights Movement, Women’s Rights Movement, and Vietnam War protests of the 1960s. At age 17 in 1969, she participated in the famous Stonewall Riots, allegedly throwing the second molotov cocktail in protest to a police raid of the Stonewall Inn gay bar. Her fearlessness in protest—she later recounted, “We were the frontliners… We had nothing to lose”— contributed to catalyzing the gay liberation movement, and she founded the Gay Liberation Front. She also co-founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries in 1970 with Marsha P. Johnson, a group that supported, empowered, and provided shelter to gay, trans, and gender-fluid youth.<br><br> 
       Her diverse and complex background—being poor, trans, a drag queen, a POC, a former sex worker, and someone who experienced drug addiction, incarceration, and homelessness—made her defiant of labels and fight for not only LGBTQ+ rights, but also racial, economic, and criminal justice issues. Initially in support of the Gay Rights Bill, she was betrayed and angered when it ultimately excluded the rights of the transgender community when she had fought so long and hard for it, leading her disappear from activism for the next 20 years. She returned to fight for trans issues in the mid-1990s amid cultural conversations about LGBTQ+ rights. Rivera is one of the central figures that ensured the transgender community was heard, loud and clear, among the push for equality for all. </p>

    <h2 id="whiteshadow"> Richard Allen </h2>
    <p> <h3> Preacher, Abolitionist, Former Slave, Educator </h3> 
    <h3> b. 1760 - 1831 </h3> </p>
    <p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTE1ODA0OTcyMDEyMzA3OTgx/richard-allen-21056735-1-402.jpg" alt="Headshot of Richard Allen" /> 
    </p>
     <p>Richard Allen was born into servitude in 1760 in Philadelphia. He earned $2,000 to buy his and his brother’s freedoms, just as the antislavery movement and denominational Christianity were gaining prominence. He is considered the founder of America’s first independent black denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, which has a membership of more than 2.5 million people and 6,000 churches today. In his biography, he wrote, “I was awakened and brought to see myself, poor, wretched and undone, and without the mercy of God must be lost.” He was ordained the church’s pastor and later elected bishop, to which he served until his death. <br><br> 
        Allen dedicated his life to the abolitionist movement and to justice: he focused his sermons on the freedoms of slaves, cessation of colonization, education for youths, and temperance; he opened a day school for black children and a night school for adults; his home and Bethel AME were stops on the Underground Railroad; he published articles in <em> Freedom’s Journal</em>; he authored three pamphlets about escaping the bonds of slavery. His fearless and inspiring legacy lives on today in the AME church’s work, exemplified through its motto: “God Our Father, Christ Our Redeemer, the Holy Spirit Our Comforter, Humankind Our Family.”</p>

    <h2 id="whiteshadow"> Fred Korematsu </h2>
    <p> <h3> Activist </h3> 
    <h3> b. 1919 - 2005 </h3> </p>
    <p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/91/34/b0/9134b042e3780a7c3316f59c0503a4a6--american-man-japanese-american.jpg" alt="Headshot of Fred Korematsu" width="45%" height="70%"/> 
    </p>
    <p>Fred Korematsu, a U.S. citizen and the son of Japanese immigrants, was born in Oakland, California. After the U.S. entered World War II, Korematsu tried to enlist in the U.S. National Guard and Coast Guard, but was rejected because of his Japanese ancestry. When President Roosevelt ordered the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII after Pearl Harbor, he refused to evacuate. At 23, he was arrested, convicted, and sent to Utah's Topaz Internment Camp. Korematsu filed a case in 1942, persuaded by the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California at the time, arguing that Korematsu’s constitutional rights had been violated and he had suffered racial discrimination. The court ruled against him, and he appealed his case all the way to the Supreme Court. In Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled against him, confirming that the denial of civil liberties based on race and national origin was legal and justified due to military necessity. <br><br>
       Later, legal historian Professor Peter Irons and researcher Aiko Herzig-Yoshinaga discovered key documents that had hidden from the Supreme Court that consistently showed that Japanese Americans had committed no acts of treason to justify mass incarceration. Korematsu’s 40-year-old case was reopened by a pro-bono legal team and his conviction was overturned in a federal court. This became a pivotal moment in civil rights history—finally bringing long-awaited justice for thousands of Asian Americans persecuted at the hands of the United States government. Korematsu remained an activist throughout his life, and his legacy continues to inspire people of all backgrounds and demonstrates the importance of speaking up to fight injustice—an important belief in the backdrop of current events. In 2011, the state of California celebrated Fred Korematsu Day on January 30th, the first day named after an Asian American in the U.S., which is now recognized by six states.

    <h2 id="whiteshadow">Henrietta Lacks</h2>
    <p> <h3> HeLa Cell Line </h3> 
    <h3> b. 1920 - 1951 </h3> </p>
    <p class="aligncenter">
    <img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SoFP5HpNvZx85cLGXk9GgCqhFn4=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/public/ERWSXCCK7A6QNGJUPW3LDZSL2A.jpg" alt="Headshot of Henrietta Lacks" width="50%" height="70%"/> 
    </p>
    <p>Henrietta Lacks was an accidental pioneer of modern-day medicine—doctors stole her cells, which are still saving countless lives today. Lacks was a 31-year-old mother of five, a poor black tobacco farmer, when she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. In another horrifying instance of decades of medical apartheid and clinical practices that discriminated against blacks, doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital sliced pieces of tissue from her tumor without her consent. Those cells became the first human cells ever bought and sold because they could be kept alive and grown indefinitely. For the past 60 years, Lack’s cells have been cultured and used in experiments that played important parts in developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, and in vitro fertilization. HeLa has been used to develop drugs for treating herpes, leukemia, influenza, and Parkinson’s disease, and have been influential in the study of cancer, lactose digestion, STD’s, and appendicitis. Her commercialized cells — worth billions of dollars — live in laboratories across the world. <br><br>
       However, her family didn’t know the cell cultures existed until more than 20 years after her death, after medical researchers that patented her tissue have generated millions of dollars in profit. Henrietta’s family had lived most of their lives in poverty, unable to afford health insurance. One of Lack’s sons was homeless and living on the streets of Baltimore. One scientist estimates that if you could lay all HeLa cells ever grown end-to-end, they’d wrap around the Earth at least three times. Her story is an example of the often-problematic intersection of ethics, race, and medicine, seen much too often in the dark history of exploitation of and experimentation on African-Americans, including the Tuskegee Syphilis Studies, the Human Radiation Experiments, and others.
