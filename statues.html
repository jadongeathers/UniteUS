    <p>At UniteUS, we are dedicated to supporting the erection of commemorative statues of accomplished individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds to replace socially unacceptable statues that remain standing in the United States.

    <h3>Statue Removal</h3>
    <p>One factor that contributes to negative social atmospheres within the United States is the display of statues (e.g. of individuals from Confederate backgrounds, or of people with unfair, corrupt, or outdated ideologies) that mark both the countryâ€™s urban and rural landscapes. Help with statue removal and installation by visiting <a href="./petitions.html">Petitions</a>.<br><br> Since these statues reflect times of utter inequality, fail to represent the modern American populace, and serve as symbols of pain for many, Americans are actively calling for their removal and replacement with more modern figures. Thus, this platform was developed to aid in facilitating their removal during these times of especially heightened American resentment against them.
    <h3>Statue Replacement</h3>
    <p>UniteUS seeks to aid in erecting commemorative statues of individuals that genuinely represent the immense diversity present within the United States. To do this, UniteUS uses a nationwide communication network, "Propose a Statue, Choose a Statue" (seen below), through which people can post their ideas for statues that can be erected within a proposed city. Then, individuals from across the nation are able to vote for the statues that they personally feel are most suitable for bringing diversity and cultural awareness to the proposed city. In this way, everyone has the chance to participate in selecting the statues that are installed nationally.
